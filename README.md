# PowerPointReportAutomation
The following project aims to automate PowerPoint-based report generation from the Employees Sample Database available at https://dev.mysql.com/doc/employee/en/ .
To do so, the Database is first uploaded into your local Database Management System (in my case, MariaDB). Then, the automation process is scripted in Python.
